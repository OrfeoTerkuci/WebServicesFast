# Web services - Weather API

## Description

After a cold winter, you are tired of this cold weather and instead, plan on making a
trip to a warm location. However, your requirements are strict, and you want to travel
to
the country that is currently the warmest. As a result,you first develop an API to find
out what location is currently the warmest.

## Usage

You can run the api by running the script `run_api.sh` and you
can run the script to get the warmest country in South America by running the
script `run_script.sh`. The script will output the warmest country in South America,
and save the image of the forecast as `forecast_<country>.png`.  
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own api key for openweathermap.

```bash
$ ./run_api.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

```bash
$ ./run_script.sh
```
